# A Java solution to The Knight's Tour

The Knight's Tour problem challenges programmers to determine all of the ways a knight can traverse a chess board
such that it travels to every square on the board once and only once.

This solution relies on a depth-first recursive algorithm as well as a stack to save valid board states.
